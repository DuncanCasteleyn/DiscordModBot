# JDADiscordBot
A Discord bot that helps with managing a Discord server/guild.

The current purpose of this project is to provide services to the Fairy tail guild and Re: zero guild.

You are free to modify the code to make it work on your own guild, but right now no support will be offered.
The plan is to make things less hard coded in the future where possible and make everything more configurable
